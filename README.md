This program was made because I asked CHATGPT to give me an assignment using the 
turtle library in haskell. 
This is what the program does. 
```
Finds all files in a directory and its subdirectories. 
sorts these files into folders based on their file extensions. 
Calculates and prints the total size of all files for each type. 
Optionally handle errors. 
```
It techincally almost does this but it handles errors by just silently ignoring them and continuing the computations. 

This program is very ugly, messy and error prone. 
But I tried my best .
