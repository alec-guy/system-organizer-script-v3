This program basically... oh god. 
You run CABAL RuN like all haskell projects. 
It does this . 
================================================================
Finds all files in a directory and its subdirectories. 
sorts these files into folders based on their file extensions. 
Calculates and prints the total size of all files for each type. 
Optionally handle errors. 
=================================================================
Except it doesnt do the last two. it doesn't optionally handle errors really 
and it doesnt calculate and print the total size of all files for each type. 
=====================================================================
It silently handles errors though.
